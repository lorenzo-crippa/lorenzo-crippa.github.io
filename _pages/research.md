My substantive political science interests divide in two interconnected streams. First, I'm interested in the exercise of state power through global governance. I intend global governance as the institutions, norms, and informal mechanisms set up by states and political actors to address problems of global collective action. My research shows multilateral agreements bolster state capacity to exercise domestic regulatory powers beyond borders. Far from meaning that states can become global regulators, however, I also show territorial connections still condition the exercise of state regulatory power.

Second, I study the international political economy of multinational companies (MNCs). I'm interested in how companies respond to global governance. Regulating MNCs is a complex global governance task. Companies can fragment their ownership and supply chains across borders to exploit loopholes and evade regulations. Regulators themselves are often better off by turning an eye blind to MNCs' activities. In my research I show that companies respond to institutionalized and norm-based sanctions to their activities. Yet, I also show that whether regulation impedes the economic activity of corporations depends on the institutional setting where companies operate.

Methodologically, I mainly address these topics employing quantitative methods. I'm interested in the application of observational and experimental designs for causal inference. My methodological research interests also include the epistemology of causal inferences derived from quantitative methods.
