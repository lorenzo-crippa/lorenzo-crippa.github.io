My substantive political science interests divide in two streams. First, I'm interested in the exercise of state power through global governance. I intend global governance as the institutions, norms, and informal mechanisms set up by states and political actors to address problems of collective action induced by globalization. My research so far has led me to challenge conventional views on territory in the regulation of globalization. I have shown that states leverage transnational private economic networks to exercise their regulatory powers abroad and diffuse policies.

Second, I study the international political economy of multinational companies (MNCs). I'm interested in how companies respond to states' global governance tools. Regulating MNCs is a complex global governance task. Companies can fragment their ownership and supply chains across borders to exploit loopholes and evade regulations. Regulators themselves are often better off by turning an eye blind to MNCs' activities. My research documented the complex responses of companies to institutionalized and norm-based sanctions to their activities.

Methodologically, I have addressed these topics employing quantitative methods. I'm interested in the application of observational and experimental designs for causal inference. My methodological research interests also include the epistemology of causal inferences derived from quantitative methods and their limits.
