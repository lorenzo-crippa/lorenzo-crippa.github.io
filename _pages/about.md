Welcome! I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Political Economy at the [University of Strathclyde](https://www.strath.ac.uk/staff/crippalorenzomr/) in Glasgow, where I am also affiliated with the [Center for Energy Policy](https://www.strath.ac.uk/humanities/centreforenergypolicy/) and the PLACE lab for computational social sciences.

I work in the field of international political economy, with a particular interest in the global governance of multinational corporations (MNCs) and international organizations. My research examines how firms contribute to global challenges (such as climate change, corruption, and illicit finance) and explores policy solutions to address these issues, including state regulation, international law and organizations, and market-based or voluntary initiatives.

Some of my research has appeared or is forthcoming in peer-reviewed journals such as _The Journal of Politics_, _International Organization_, and _Political Science Research & Methods_. I have published research primarily in the context of corporate corruption and climate behavior. Methodologically, I employ computational methods for causal inference and text analysis.
