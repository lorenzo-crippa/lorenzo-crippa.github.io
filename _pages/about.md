Hi! I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the School of Government and Public Policy at the University of Strathclyde. I obtained my PhD in 2022 at the University of Essex, Department of Government. I am interested in international regulatory politics and the governance of multinational companies. I focus particularly on corporate crime and environmental regulation.

In my PhD dissertation I study states' prosecution of corporate crime. I focus on how states can extend their sovereign coercive powers beyond borders. I argue that, contrary to conventional political economy wisdom, states can wield regulations against multinational companies' foreign crime by leveraging the very cross-border corporate networks used to further criminal activity. That is, fragmentation of corporate ownership can be employed as a regulatory leverage to diffuse business standards. I study scope and limits of this regulatory strategy.

Before studying at Essex, I received a Master's degree in International Relations and Diplomatic Sciences, specialisation in International Political Economy (honors) from the University of Bologna (IT), and a Bachelor degree in Philosophy (honors) from the University of Milan (IT).
