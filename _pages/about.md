Welcome! I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Political Economy at the [University of Strathclyde](https://www.strath.ac.uk/staff/crippalorenzomr/) in Glasgow, where I am also affiliated with the [Center for Energy Policy](https://www.strath.ac.uk/humanities/centreforenergypolicy/) and the newly-established PLACE lab for computational social sciences.

I research in the field of international political economy, with a particular interest in the global governance of multinational companies (MNCs) and international organizations. My primary goal is to study the behaviors of firms as they contribute to global issues (e.g., climate change, corruption, or illicit finance). I explore solutions to address these challenges, including state regulation, international law/organizations, and market-based or voluntary initiatives. I have studied these themes mainly in the realm of corporate corruption and climate behavior. Methodologically, I apply computational methods for causal inference and text analysis.

Some of my research has appeared or is forthcoming in peer-reviewed journals like _International Organization_, _Political Science Research & Methods_, and _The Review of International Organizations_.
