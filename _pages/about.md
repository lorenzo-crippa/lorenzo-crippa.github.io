Welcome! I am a Lecturer in Political Economy at the University of Strathclyde. 

I do research in the field of international political economy, with a particular interest in firms, international organizations, and the global governance of multinational companies (MNCs). My primary goal is to study the behaviors of firms as they contribute to global issues. I explore solutions to address these challenges, including state regulation, international law/organizations, and market-based or voluntary initiatives. I study these themes mainly in the realm of bribery and climate behavior.

Part of my work (including my PhD thesis and related projects) investigates the regulation of corporate corruption. I have studied how states enforced anti-bribery international policies and their effects on FDI, portfolio performance, and offshore financial flows. Beyond corporate bribery, I focus on environmental behavior, greenwashing, and international climate negotiations. Methodologically, I apply computational methods for causal inference and text analysis.
