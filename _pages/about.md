Hi! I am a PhD student from the [Department of Government at the University of Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/cripp64301/lorenzo-crippa) and Associate Lecturer (Teaching Fellow) in the [Department of Political Science at UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/political-science/people/academic-teaching-and-research-staff/lorenzo-crippa). I am interested in the governance of globalization. I study how states cooperate to regulate multinational companies and prevent corporate crime. I am interested in what the study of corporate regulation can teach about state-business relationships and about the possibility for states to extend coercive powers beyond borders.

In my PhD thesis I focus on the regulation of corporate foreign bribery. I argue that this case challenges conventional views on the possibilities for states to regulate globalization. Conventionally, political economy claims that multinational companies leverage their trans-nationality to evade regulations. I show that states can exploit companies' territorial fragmentation for regulatory purposes, against the conventional view that cross-border fragmentation of legal structures is necessarily an advantage for companies and a weakness for states. In fact, I show that states can exploit companies’ territorial fragmentation for regulatory purposes in three ways. First, states can enlist domestically-incorporated companies to diffuse regulatory business standards in countries down the line of their ownership chain. Second, states can leverage cross-border fragmentation of corporate ownership in order to enforce regulation against companies who are in breach of criminal laws. Third, territorial fragmentation of companies’ ownership propagates the damage to reputation induced by state regulatory action, turning multinational ownership on its head, into a liability for companies.

Before studying at Essex, I received a Master's degree in International Relations and Diplomatic Sciences, specialisation in International Political Economy (honors) from the University of Bologna (IT), and a Bachelor degree in Philosophy (honors) from the University of Milan (IT).
