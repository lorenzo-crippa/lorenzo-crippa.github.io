Hi! I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the School of Government and Public Policy at the University of Strathclyde. I obtained my PhD in 2022 at the University of Essex, Department of Government. I am interested in international regulatory politics and the governance of multinational companies (MNCs). I focus particularly on corporate crime and environmental regulation.

My PhD thesis has investigated the international political economy of regulations against corporate corruption. I have studied the effects of anti-bribery regulations on companies' foreign investment and portfolio performance. I showed that countries can leverage rules agreed-upon under the umbrella of international agreements to impose regulatory costs, thus deterring misconduct and pushing their regulatory reach beyond borders. I argued that, under international agreements, states can wield regulations against MNCs' foreign crime by leveraging the very cross-border corporate networks that firms use to further criminal activity. I studied scope and limits of this regulatory strategy.

My current research expands my interest on regulatory politics and the governance of MNCs beyond corporate bribery. I currently apply similar tools developed in my PhD to focus on environmental regulation and international climate negotiations.
