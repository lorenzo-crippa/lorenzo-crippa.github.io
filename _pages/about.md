Welcome! I am a Lecturer in Political Economy at the University of Strathclyde. 

I do research in the field of international political economy, with a particular interest in firms, international organizations, and the global governance of multinational companies (MNCs). My primary goal is to study the behaviors of firms as they contribute to and potentially solve global issues. I explore solutions to address these challenges. I often investigate whether, and to what extent, international markets and their main actors (MNCs, investors) can promote or obstacle the furtherance of social and political goals.

Part of my work (including my PhD thesis and related projects) investigates these themes in the case of the regulation of corporate corruption. I have studied how states enforced anti-bribery international policies and their effects on FDI, portfolio performance, or offshore financial flows. I currently expand my interest in the global governance of MNCs beyond corporate bribery, to study corporate environmental behavior, greenwashing, and international climate negotiations. Methodologically, I apply computational methods for causal inference and text analysis to the study of regulatory politics and global governance.
