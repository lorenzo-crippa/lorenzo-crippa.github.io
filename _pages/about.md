I am a PhD student from the [Department of Government at the University of Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/cripp64301/lorenzo-crippa) and Associate Lecturer (Teaching Fellow) in the [Department of Political Science at UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/political-science/people/academic-teaching-and-research-staff/lorenzo-crippa). I am interested in the governance of globalization. I study how states regulate multinational companies and corporate crime using domestic, bilateral, and multilateral legal instruments. I am interested in what can be learnt about state-business relationships in a globalized market from the study of corporate regulation.

In my PhD thesis I focus on the regulation of corporate foreign bribery. I argue that this case challenges conventional views on the possibilities for states to regulate globalization. It shows that states can exploit companies' territorial fragmentation for regulatory purposes, against the conventional view that cross-border fragmentation of supply chains weakens state regulatory action because it lets companies circumvent it. The three papers that constitute the dissertation make three distinct contributions to the matter. The first shows that states can enlist domestically-incorporated multinational companies to diffuse cleaner behaviors in countries down the line of their ownership chain. The second shows that states leverage cross-border fragmentation of corporate ownership in order to enforce regulatory prerogatives against companies in breach of standards. The third shows that fragmentation of companies' ownership across territories propagates the reputational damage induced by state regulatory action, turning multinational ownership into a liability for companies.

Before studying at Essex, I received a Master's degree in International Relations and Diplomatic Sciences, specialisation in International Political Economy (honors) from the University of Bologna (IT), and a Bachelor degree in Philosophy (honors) from the University of Milan (IT).
