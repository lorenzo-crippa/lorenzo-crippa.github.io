Hi! I am a PhD student from the Department of Government at the University of Essex and incoming Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Politics at the University of Strathclyde (from July 2022). I am interested in state-business relations under globalization. I study states' regulation of multinational companies and prevention of corporate crime. On the one hand, I focus on multilateral cooperation among states to this aim. On the other, I am interested in what the study of corporate regulation can teach about state sovereignty and extension of coercive powers beyond borders.

In my PhD thesis I focus on the regulation of corporate foreign bribery. I argue that this case challenges conventional views on the possibilities for states to regulate globalization. Conventionally, political economy claims that multinational companies leverage trans-nationality to evade regulations. I show that states can exploit companies' territorial fragmentation for regulatory purposes, against the conventional view that cross-border fragmentation of legal structures is necessarily an advantage for companies and a weakness for states. In fact, I show that states can exploit companiesâ€™ territorial fragmentation for regulatory purposes in three ways. First, states can enlist domestically-incorporated companies to diffuse regulatory business standards in countries down the line of their ownership chain. Second, states can leverage cross-border fragmentation of corporate ownership in order to enforce regulation against companies who are in breach of criminal laws. However, companies are not helpless in this regulatory confrontation. In fact, I show that they can leverage ownership fragmentation to limit the damage induced by state regulatory action on markets.

Before studying at Essex, I received a Master's degree in International Relations and Diplomatic Sciences, specialisation in International Political Economy (honors) from the University of Bologna (IT), and a Bachelor degree in Philosophy (honors) from the University of Milan (IT).
