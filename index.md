I am a PhD student from the [Department of Government at the University of Essex (UK)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/cripp64301/lorenzo-crippa) and Associate Lecturer (Teaching Fellow) in the [Department of Political Science at the University College London (UK)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/political-science/people/academic-teaching-and-research-staff/lorenzo-crippa). I am interested in the construction, enforcement and effects of states' laws and international institutions that regulate firms' behaviors.

In my PhD thesis I focus on the multilateral cooperation to regulate corporate foreign bribery. I seek to explain variations in state capacity to hold corporations accountable for exporting corruption. I approach my study employing quantitative methods, and bringing together insights from the literature on international institutions and on political-economic determinants of firms' behaviors.

I received a Master's degree in International Relations and Diplomatic Sciences, specialisation in International Political Economy (full marks and honours) from the University of Bologna (IT), and a Bachelor degree in Philosophy (full marks and honours) from the University of Milan (IT).
